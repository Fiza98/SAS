EXPLAINATION:

You can specify the following statements with the REG procedure in addition to the
PROC REG statement:

ADD adds independent variables to the regression model.
BY specifies variables to define subgroups for the analysis.
DELETE deletes independent variables from the regression model.
FREQ specifies a frequency variable.
ID names a variable to identify observations in the tables.
MODEL specifies the dependent and independent variables in the regression
model, requests a model selection method, displays predicted
values, and provides details on the estimates (according to which
options are selected).
MTEST performs multivariate tests across multiple dependent variables.
OUTPUT creates an output data set and names the variables to contain predicted
values, residuals, and other diagnostic statistics.
PAINT paints points in scatter plots.
PLOT generates scatter plots.
PRINT displays information about the model and can reset options.
REFIT refits the model.
RESTRICT places linear equality restrictions on the parameter estimates.
REWEIGHT excludes specific observations from analysis or changes the
weights of observations used.
TEST performs an F test on linear functions of the parameters.
VAR lists variables for which cross products are to be computed, variables
that can be interactively added to the model, or variables to
be used in scatter plots.
WEIGHT declares a variable to weight observations.
